# My first C++ Program
This is the first C++ programming project in ITCS-2530.
The program is a camping-packing assistant.
The program takes several user inputs regarding the user's upcoming trip.
The program then outputs the supplies they should bring based on the user's input. 
The program produces a menu which asks user to add an itinerary,
save and print to screen, or save only. Thanks for reading!
