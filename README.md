# My first C++ assignment
This is the first programming assignment in ITCS-2530
This is a camper-packing assistant.
The program takes three int variables: no. of campers, nights they will stay and the no. of fires
they plan to start.
The program then outputs the supplies they should bring based on the user's input. 
The program produces a menu which asks user to
save the camping list to a .txt file, display on the screen or both.
Thanks for reading!
